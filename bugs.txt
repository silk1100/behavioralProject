** DataDivisor
	* BUG TYPE: Coding-Technical-implementation

	DataDivisor main function
	*	divisor = DataDivisor(df, df_p, 'srs')
   	        df = divisor.divide()
     	        df = divisor.get_group('comm','mild')

	Running Ipython in (D:\phd\codes\behavioralProject\data\feature_extraction\medianMinusPlus) while reading the phenotype file from 
	(D:\PhD\codes\behavioralProject\data)
	*	df = pd.read_csv('raw.csv', index_col='subj_id')
	*	comm = df['SRS_COMMUNICATION_T']
	*	comm_nona = comm.dropna()
	*	len(comm_nona[(comm_nona['SRS_COMMUNICATION_T']>=60)&(comm_nona['SRS_COMMUNICATION_T']<=65)]) = 50

	* Both values are expected to be the same.

	[SOLVED!!] In the first case the operation is made on the dataframee of the join between the data and the second one is running only on the phenotype 
		   file which has more subjects.

	1. Not all of the subjects have conducted the whole SRS test. I assume that some of them are diagnosed once 2 or 3 tests pass the minimum total score
	   to be diagnosed as ASD. Therefore, the test is concluded and the subject is diagnosed.

	2. I have been using the overall diagnosis (TD/ASD) which is found in column "DX_GROUP" to classify between subjects instead of using a specific SRS
	   test score. The problem is that some of the subjects can score a moderate ASD score in a specific SRS module while they score TD in the rest modules
 	   Therefore, they get the overall diagnoses to be TD even though they posses some ASD traits. A more comprehensive experiment would be for each module
	   three classifiers are made (sever vs td), (moderate vs td), and (mild vs td) while totally ignoring the DX_Group index. A new subject is then passed to
	   the three classifiers and assigned to the class with highest probability.
