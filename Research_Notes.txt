*** Notes

	**The SRS T scores have a range: 59 or below is TD/normal. 60-65 is mild, 66-75 is moderate, and above 76 is severe.
	Your data looks like that spread holds true.**

* Found subjects that are diagnosed TD and have a moderate ASD score in communication ("KKI_29322", "OHSU_1_28950")
* Subject KUL_3_29658 is diagnosed ASD with score SRS_TOTAL = 59 and KUL_3_29656 is diagnosed ASD with score SRS_TOTAL=47

** Not all of the SRS tests are conducted to all subjects. Some subjects has only 3 tests, then the SRS_total is computed for only those 3 test, therefore
it is less than 59 and the subject is still diagnosed to be autistic. 
** QUESTION: Within each module should I classify based on the score ranges (sever, mild and moderate) or based on the overall score**
** ANSWER: Whenever I use SRS module, I remove the original diagnosis and add a new diagnosis based on the module score, so a TD might be assigned to be ASD if he scores high enough
           in that module

*** New Contributions
* I specified a run without a feature selection using only 3 classifiers (logistic regression, linear SVM, and Xgboost trees) in order to find the optimum hyper parameters that can
be used for feature selection process.

** Perform the whole pipeline using regressors in stead of classifiers. Select features based on regressors that will minimize the error between the correct SRS score and the predicted
ones, then use those features to train different regressors to predict SRS score.

** Aggregate the results of different models (classifiers/regressors) trained on different SRS modules to get a final diagnosis.
